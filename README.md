RESN stands for REst Service Notation. It is a JSON based description format for REST interfaces, as well as an engine that will generate the methods needed to access those services based on the description given. It provides validation for incoming and outgoing data using JSONSchema. RESN does not use any 3rd party ajax libraries to run in the client, but can. ***NOT RUNNING IN NODE RIGHT NOW***

### An example...
Here is a very trivial example where we define two resources and four methods.

```javascript
    var app = new RESN({

      users: {
        list: ['get', '/api/users/:partialname'],
        update: ['post', '/api/apps/:username']
      },

      apps: {
        list: ['get', '/api/apps/:username'],
        create: ['post', '/api/apps/:username/:appname']
      }

    });
```

The RESN constructor takes a single object literal containing members grouped by resource. Resources are then expressed as arrays. In the simplest case, there must be a verb and a path. Each path can have tokens in it that will get supplanted when called. Here is our above definition put to use...

```javascript
    app.users.list(

      { partialname: 'jo' },

      function(error, response) {
        
        console.log(error || response);
      }

    );
```

The `list` function was generated from its definition in the `users` group. We pass it 1) an object literal that supplants the token in the request url and 2) a callback function that will process when the request is done.

### The same example with validation...
In most cases you will want to make assertions on the outgoing and incoming data.

```javascript
    var app = new RESN({

      users: {
        list: ['get', '/api/users/:partialname', { out: JSONSchemaA, in: JSONSchemaB }],
        update: ['post', '/api/apps/:username']
      },

      apps: {
        list: ['get', '/api/apps/:username'],
        create: ['post', '/api/apps/:username/:appname']
      }

    });
```

### A more complex example...

```javascript
    var app = new RESN({

      users: {
        list: ['get', '/api/users/:partialname', { out: JSONSchemaList, in: JSONSchemaB }],
        update: ['post', '/api/apps/:username', { in: JSONSchemaC }]
      },

      apps: {
        list: ['get', '/api/apps/:username', { in: JSONSchemaD }],
        create: ['post', '/api/apps/:username/:appname', { in: JSONSchemaE }]
      }

    }).use({
      port: 8080,
      in: JSONSchmeaF,
      out: JSONSchmeaA,
      headers: { 'Accept': 'application/json' }
    });
```

The `use` function sets the defaults for all calls that get made. It accepts an object literal containing the following members...

`port` Number - The port of the server that will accept the requests.<br/>
`in` Object - A JSONSchema object that will validate against every incoming request.<br/>
`out` Object - A JSONSchema object that will validate against every outgoing request.<br/>
`host` String - An IP address of the host server that will accept the requests.<br/>
`headers` Object - An object literal of HTTP request headers that will be attached to each request.<br/>
`protocol` String - The protocol to be used for all requests, ie 'http', 'https'.<br/>
`lib` Object - If you want to use a more full featured, cross-browser friendly ajax library.<br/>

And here is the above code in use...

```javascript
    app.headers['Authorization'] = 'Basic ' + encodeBase64('username:password');

    app.users.update(
      
      { partialname: 'johnny' },
      { address: '555 Mockingbird Ln' },
      
      function(error, response) {
        console.log(error || response);
      }
    );
```

The `update` function was generated from its definition in the `users` group. We pass it a payload object, some data to replace the url tokens with and a callback function for when the request has finished processing. The app object will also expose the headers collection, this is simply an object literal that contains the headers to be used for the request.
