RSAN is a REST Service Application Notation. An abstraction meant to reduce the boiler plate code associated with making network requests. RSAN does not use any 3rd party ajax libraries to run in the client, but can. ***NOT RUNNING IN NODE RIGHT NOW***

### An example...
Here is a very trivial example where we define two resources and four methods.

    var rson = new RSAN({

      users: {
        list: ['get', '/api/users/:partialname'],
        update: ['post', '/api/apps/:username']
      },

      apps: {
        list: ['get', '/api/apps'],
        create: ['post', '/api/apps/:username/:appname']
      }

    });

The RSAN constructor takes a single object literal containing members grouped by resource. Each member can have tokens in them that get supplanted when called. Here is our above definition put to use...

    rson.users.list(

      { partialname: 'jo' },

      function(error, response) {
        console.log(error || response);
      }

    );

The `users` function was generated from its definition in the `get` group. We pass it 1) an object literal that supplants the values in the request url and 2) a callback function that will process when the request is done.

### A more complex example...

    var deed = new RSAN({
      
      get: {
        users: '/api/users/:partialname',

        apps: '/api/apps/:partialname',
        appsBy: '/api/apps/:username',

        servers: '/api/servers',
        auth: '/api'
      },
      
      post: {
        users: '/api/users'
      },
      
      delete: {
        users: '/api/users/:username'
      }

    }).use({
      port: 8080,
      headers: { 'Accept': 'application/json' }
    });

The RSAN constructer returns itself, so the `use` function can be chained to it. The `use` function sets the defaults for all calls that get made. It accepts an object literal containing the following members...

`port` Number - The port of the server that will accept the requests.<br/>
`host` String - An IP address of the host server that will accept the requests.<br/>
`headers` Object - An object literal of HTTP request headers that will be attached to each request.<br/>
`protocol` String - The protocol to be used for all requests, ie 'http', 'https'.<br/>
`lib` Object - If you want to use a more full featured, cross-browser friendly ajax library.<br/>

And here is the above code in use...

    deed.headers['Authorization'] = 'Basic ' + encodeBase64('username:password');

    deed.post.users(

      { foo: 'data' },

      function(error, response) {

        console.log(error || response);

      }
    );

The `users` function was generated from its definition in the `post` group. We pass it a payload object, and  callback function for when the request has finished processing. The deed object will also expose the headers collection, this is simply an object literal that contains the
headers to be used for the request.
