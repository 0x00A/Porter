# Deeds.js
Deeds is a very simple client side Data Access Layer. An abstraction meant to reduce the boiler plate code associated with making ajax calls. Currently this uses jQuery to make ajax requests. There are plans to remove the dependency eventually, as well as make it node.js module-capable.

### An example...
Here is a very trivial example. An application defines several calls to the Middle-end which are grouped by the HTTP verb that they will use.

    var deed = new deeds({
      
      get: {
        users: '/api/users/:partialname',
        apps: '/api/apps/'
      },
      
      post: {
        users: '/api/users'
      }
      
    });

The deeds constructor takes a single object literal containing paths grouped by the HTTP verb that they will use. The paths can have tokens in them that get supplanted when called. Here is our above definition put to use...

    deed.get.users(

      { partialname: 'johnny' },

      function(error, response) {
        console.log(error || response);
      }

    );

The `users` function was generated from its definition in the `get` group. We pass it 1) an object literal that supplants the values in the request url and 2) a callback function that will process when the request is done.

### A more complex example...

    var deed = new deeds({
      
      get: {
        users: '/api/users/:partialname',

        apps: '/api/apps/:partialname',
        appsBy: '/api/apps/:username',

        servers: '/api/servers',
        auth: '/api'
      },
      
      post: {
        users: '/api/users'
      },
      
      delete: {
        users: '/api/users/:username'
      }

    }).use({
      port: 8080,
      headers: { 'Accept': 'application/json' }
    });

The deeds constructer returns itself, so the `use` function can be chained to it. The `use` function sets the defaults for all calls that get made. It accepts an object literal containing the following members...

`port` {number} - The port of the server that will accept the requests.<br/>
`host` {string} - An IP address of the host server that will accept the requests.<br/>
`headers` {object} - An object literal of HTTP request headers that will be attached to each request.<br/>
`protocol` {string} - The protocol to be used for all requests, ie 'http', 'https'.<br/>

And here is the above code in use...

    deed.post.users(

      { foo: 'data' },

      function(xhr) {
        xhr.setRequestHeader('authorization', 'Basic ' + encodeBase64('user:password'));
      },

      function(error, response) {
        
        console.log(error || response);
      }

    );

The `users` function was generated from its definition in the `post` group. We pass it 1) a payload object, 2) a function to dynamically set the headers associated with this particular request, and 3) a callback function for when the request has finished processing.
